Bug fixes:
[X] Add any new entry at the end of GtkTreeView, not in the cursor
    position.  This bug is valid on ping, traceroute and scan.

General:
[ ] Add gconf support to store:
    - Last host requested
	- Last settings used (count ping, netstat query, etc)
[ ] Implement information of network devices
    [X] Add support for IPv6
	[ ] To implement "link state" and "collission"
[X] Implement traceroute (with tcp and/or icmp)
[X] Implement netstat
[X] Add DNS query
[X] Add Whois query
[X] Add support to IPv6 (ping6, traceroute6, network interface)
[ ] Add Copy-to-clipboard on Information (info.c)
[X] Show error messages, feeback to the user.
    (for instance: Host not found)
[ ] Glib-ize util-mii

i18n:
[X] Add internacionalization support (mostly add files in POTFILES.in)

UI:
[ ] A graphical traceroute
[X] A better ping output: GtkTreeView instead GtkTextView and 
    a label to show the perfomance every time.
[ ] Accept arguments by command line.

Portability:
[-] Multiplataform support (may be with a ping/traceroute helper to
    process de same output)
[X] Detection of network devices
[X] Add *BSD support in ping command/output
