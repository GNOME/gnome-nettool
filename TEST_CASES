Test Cases

(If you find another test case, please let me know).

User interaction:

 * Toggle buttons and sensitive:

 1. For:
 	a) Enter a right hostname and press return; and
	b) Enter a right hostname push Ping button

	The UI must:
    - The host entry must toggle to insensitive
    - The button Ping must change to Stop

	And try:
	1.1 Wait until the process stop automatically
		- The host entry must toggle to sensitive
		- The button Stop must change to Ping

	1.2 Push the Stop button to stop the process
		- The host entry must toggle to sensitive
		- The button Stop must change to Ping

 2. Try the items in 1, with a bad hostname
   (inexistent, by example: aeiou)
  
 3. Try 1 and 2, with differnt counts (minimal,
    maximal, medium)


Process Interacion:

  For 1, 2 and 3, compare the results (format) shown
  on the GUI with the console program equivalent.


Known Issues:
  On same error cases (2) the GUI doesn't show
  any text, because de GIOChannel doesn' return any
  value, but GIOCondition is G_IO_IN. 
  (see ping.c - io_text_buffer_dialog)
